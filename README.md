# Water-Quality-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Project
This project focuses on analyzing water quality parameters and building machine learning models to classify water potability and predict pH values. It includes complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, visualizations (correlation heatmaps, boxplots), and implementation of both classification and regression algorithms.
